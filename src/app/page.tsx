          My virtual trade project is a web-based application designed to
          simulate cryptocurrency trading. It allows users to buy and sell
          virtual assets using a simulated USD balance. The platform features
          real-time price updates for various cryptocurrencies, providing users
          with an immersive experience as they make decisions based on market
          fluctuations. The project includes a secure user authentication
          system, a dynamic portfolio tracking feature, and a seamless
          transaction process that updates both the user&apos;s balance and
          portfolio in real-time. By leveraging technologies such as Next.js,
          Node.js, and MongoDB, the application offers a smooth, intuitive
          interface while handling backend operations like data storage and
          retrieval efficiently. This project is a valuable learning experience
          in both front-end and back-end development, with a focus on building
          secure and scalable web applications.
